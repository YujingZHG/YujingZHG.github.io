  <h1><b> My assignment.html page for linking to assignment items for your Website Assesment</b></h1>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>This page is the marking guide to your website that your tutor will use to find your elements. Do not name this
    page anything other than assignment.html (all lower case) or else we may not be able to find and mark your
    assignment elements.<span>&nbsp; </span>How to use this page:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Please, link this page to your website's index.html page</li>
    <li>over time, link each assignment task listed below to its location in your website as soon as you have started it
    </li>
    <li>replace the "notes" paragraph with your notes or
      delete if you have no notes - your notes will help us understand and
      mark your site so you should explain things. Maybe you did a task
      differently from the way we specified it, either because your way is
      better (tell us) or minimally or not at all to fit in with your site's
      look and feel (tell us) or ... (also tell us). So, for example, a video
      might spoil the look and feel. What you do is make one anyway, link to
      it from this assessment.html page and explain in the <i>Notes</i> why
      it's not linked to from your public version of your web site. You can
      style this page as your like, so long as you keep the links to the
      assignment tasks.</li>
    <li>provide link to report where indicated</li>
    <li>delete these instructions when you are ready</li>
  </ul>
  <p><br></p>
  <h1><b>Website Topic</b></h1>
  <p>My-Homepage</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Why I choose this topic? I'm excited to develop my own website as a canvas for my art and photography hobby and
      share my idea. When I make a new friend and talked about hobbies, you know it is annoying to find pictures from
      different platform and the photo folders on the phone, because they are usually mix with other photos. I really
      need a webpage working as my “business card”.
    </li>
    <li>
      And it is not just about showing my work, it's about creating a personal connection. My website will be a place
      where I can share my latest drawings and photos, without the limitations of social media apps, and the
      inconvenience of accessibility platforms across different countries. This digital space will reflects my growth
      offering a glimpse into my life and thoughts. It's important to me that this website serves as a more accessible
      and direct way to my friends, family, and anyone interested in my art, without the compression or algorithmic
      barriers of social platforms.
    </li>
    <li>
      The mission is building a site that not only displays my work in the way I want but also becomes a part of my
      journey, constantly updated with new pieces and experiences. This project is a meaningful way to express myself
      and connect with others over shared interests.
    </li>
  </ul>
