                <p>
                    While developing on this static webpage, I've learned valuable skills about <abbr
                        title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>,
                    and <abbr title="JavaScript">JavaScript</abbr>. One thing is the importance of connecting various
                    content and maintaining consistency across the webpage. For instance, setting up a navigation bar,
                    designing page layouts, and implementing a carousel for image transitions showed me how different
                    files and styles need to work together. Keeping the design consistent across pages not only makes
                    the site visually coherent but also enhances efficiency by allowing for the reuse of code.
                </p>
                <h2 class="blue_title">Reflection to be Better</h2>
                <h3>I.The Development process</h3>
                <p>
                    If I had the chance to redesign the website, I would start with a clear plan for the content on each
                    page. This approach would help me minimize the number of pages, simplifying the maintenance of the
                    site. Additionally, during the initial design, my CSS file grew to 500 lines because I was adjusting
                    the design as I coded, without a clear strategy on which styles could be shared across pages. Moving
                    forward, I would extract common CSS styles into one file and place specific styles for each page at
                    the end of their respective files. This organization would make the code easier to manage and
                    modify, improving overall maintenance and clarity.
                </p>
                <h3>II.The Theme</h3>
                <p>
                    While working on the website design, I learned how complex and challenging it can be to manage
                    multiple themes. Initially, I attempted to incorporate various topics into the website, which I
                    thought would make it more interesting.I find the more themes I tried to include, the harder it was
                    to create a cohesive and user-friendly design. This experience taught me the importance of
                    simplicity and focus in website design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Given another opportunity, I would focus solely on the photography aspect. This would not only
                    streamline the content and make the website more coherent but also allow me to enhance the quality
                    of the specific content related to photography. By concentrating on a single theme, the website
                    would be easier to navigate and more appealing to users who are specifically interested in
                    photography.
